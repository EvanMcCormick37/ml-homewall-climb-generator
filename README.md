# Welcome to Beta-Zero

### Using machine-learning to set climbs on spray walls and system boards.

## Full-Stack Application (Work-In-Progress)

This is an open-source application which leverages ML models to set custom climbs on homewalls and system boards. It is also an open repository of climbs and spray-walls/system boards. The workflow is as follows:

* Upload your homewall and climb geometry
* Add climbs to the database
* Filter climbs by grade and style
* Generate Climbs for your wall using the DDPM Generator model

## Making Climbs for the Sideways Wall

See my write-up about this stage of the project here: https://evmojo37.substack.com/p/beta-zero-alpha-can-ai-set-climbs

The original project was completed within `feature-generation` and `model-training`. `feature-generation` involved creating the training data (holds and climbs) using a custom React-Vite UI. `model-training` consisted of processing the holds and climbs data into useable training data, and training the ML models.

### Feature-Generation (React Vite -> JSON output)

This is a simple React-Vite application which allows the user to upload a photograph of their home-wall/spray-wall, and then manually add a set of hand/foot holds, embedded via 6 feature vectors (_**x, y, pull_x, pull_y, useability, is_hand**_). It is, unfortunately, no longer in use and is un-maintained. I am currently in the process of porting some of the functionality of `feature-generation` into `climb-front-end`, which when complete will involve a more comprehensive version of the original workflow.

### BoardLib Dataset

This iteration of BetaZero was trained on the Aurora climbs dataset, using the amazing open-source BoardLib API: https://github.com/lemeryfertitta/BoardLib.

### Model-Training (DDPM)

The latest version uses a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) to generate climbs as point clouds, where each point corresponds to a hold used in the climb. It then guides the generated points to actual valid holds via Manifold Guidance. Finally, a U-Net hold classifier decides which holds in the climb should get which roles (Start, Finish, Hand, Foot). It only just occurred to me that it might be preferable to assign roles at the start of the denoising process and allow them to help my climb generator generate valid climbs. Oh,well. That will be in the first update. My utility classes for DDPM climb generation and model training can be found in the 'model-training' directory.

The climbs you see being generated here are completely novel climbs generated by a Diffusion generative model! The coolest part about this model is that it should in theory be able to generate reasonable climbs for *any* system board, provided that the user accurately uploads the board's hold positions. I need to find a way to deploy this to the cloud.
