### Using machine-learning to set climbs on spray walls and system boards.

This is an open-source application which leverages ML models to set custom climbs on homewalls and system boards. It is also an open repository of climbs and spray-walls/system boards.

* Upload your homewall and climb geometry
* Add climbs to the database
* Train MLP, RNN, and LSTM models on your wall's climbs
* Filter climbs by grade and style
